    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    This is the landing page of my portfolio. There are many interesting things to visit from the top bar. Some of the examples for in-browser require javascript for interactivity, and the syntax highlighting engine uses javascript + dom manipulation.
    <br><br>Fun fact, every piece of this website, including the templating engine and web server serving this page, was written from scratch!
